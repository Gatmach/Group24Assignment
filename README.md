## Blender Shading Tutorial Video

## 1. Project Overview:
In this tutorial series, we explore and demonstrate two essential shading techniques in computer graphics: Phong Shading and Gouraud Shading — implemented in Blender, a leading 3D design and animation tool.
You'll learn how to apply both techniques step-by-step on a circle mesh (radius: 3 units), positioned precisely at the centre of the scene (0, 0, 0). These demonstrations aim to highlight the visual differences between vertex-level (Gouraud) and pixel-level (Phong) lighting calculations.

## 2. Instructions

## Model Setup:
-Start Blender and create a circle with a radius of 3 units, centred at the origin.
-Ensure proper lighting and camera setup for clarity.
-Demonstrate the Following Shading Models:
## A. Phong Shading Tutorial

This tutorial introduces Phong Shading by explaining its core components: ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, and how they contribute to realistic surface illumination.
Using Blender, the video demonstrates how to:
Apply smooth shading for seamless surface transitions
Use the Principled BSDF shader to replicate Phong-like reflections
Adjust lighting and material settings to control the intensity and sharpness of highlights
Each step is clearly explained, from material setup to rendering, showcasing how Phong shading produces smooth, visually rich specular effects.

## B. Gouraud Shading Tutorial
This tutorial explains Gouraud Shading, focusing on how lighting is calculated at the vertex level and then interpolated across the surface to create smooth transitions.
Using Blender, the video demonstrates how to approximate Gouraud shading through custom shader nodes or lighting techniques that simulate vertex-based illumination.
A visual comparison with Phong Shading is included to highlight the key differences, particularly in how each method renders specular highlights and overall surface realism.

## 3. Learning Objectives

- Gain practical understanding of two popular shading models.
- Learn how to manipulate Blender’s material and lighting systems.
- Enhance technical communication through video instruction.
- Visualise the impact of different shading techniques in real-time rendering.

## 4. Tools & Technologies Used

Software: Blender
Screen Recording: OBS Studio
Platform: YouTube (for hosting videos)

## 5. Video Goals

- Set up a consistent Blender scene for both demonstrations (circle, lighting, camera).
- Apply each shading model accurately and explain each step.
- Include annotations, voice-over, or captions to enhance clarity.
- Provide direct comparisons between the two techniques.
